## Sampling

Sampling involves capturing and storing digital/analogue? representations of sound for playback. This technique allows for the manipulation and processing of recorded audio.

## Additive Synthesis

Additive synthesis builds complex sounds by combining multiple sine waves of varying frequencies, phases, and amplitudes. These sine waves are added together to create more complex timbres.

Synths/recordings:

  - Gabor Lazor + Mark Fell
- Wendy Carlos - Beauty In The Beast -- recreating acoustic instrument sounds and "impossible" instruments
- Boards of Canada
- Buchla 1/4/8

## Multiple Wavetable Synthesis

Multiple wavetable synthesis involves using multiple wavetables, which are arrays of pre-calculated waveform samples, to generate sound. By interpolating between these wavetables, a wide variety of sounds can be created.

## Wave Terrain Synthesis

Wave terrain synthesis is a technique that models sound as a landscape, where the shape of the terrain corresponds to the sound waveform. This method allows for the creation of evolving and dynamic sounds.

## Granular Synthesis

Granular synthesis involves breaking down sound into tiny grains and manipulating them individually. This technique enables the creation of complex textures and timbres by rearranging and modulating these grains.

## Subtractive Synthesis

Subtractive synthesis involves starting with complex waveforms and filtering out unwanted frequencies using filters such as low-pass, high-pass, and band-pass filters. This process is commonly used in analog synthesizers.

## Modulation 1: RM, SSM, and AM

## Modulation II: FM, PM, PD, and GM
