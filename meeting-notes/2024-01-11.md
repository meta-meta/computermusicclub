# Questions / Comments

- why preamp? preamps are better at dealing with the noise inherent to electronic signals. There is never not noise, but dealing with it is less of a problem now.

- What modeling the perceptual attributes vs. physical attributes new efficient synthesis techniques have been discovered and developed that are based on modeling the perceptual attributes of sound rather than the physical attributes;

- Greg: surround sound immersive audio ambisonics
- Cool oversampling - band limited impulse response
- zipper noises floor dithering

_from ptrk:_

- lowpass filters
- intention!

1. Damn computers being able to make music is rad! They can make any sound and that is crazy! (not “any sound” maybe… still figuring out what I believe on this, but that’s why you gotta come to the meeting!)
2. Always nice to be reminded about the difference between Analog and Digital
3. Also always fun to think about sounds being physical things. @lizzardbreath777 asked a really good question this morning: “Is sound affected by gravity” and I was like damn I don’t actually know.
4. Science and art… each have different motivations but sometimes they meet in the middle somehow?
5. It must have been insane to “see” the first waveform (probably etched on wax?)!
6. Curtis throws some shade at vinyl which is awesome and hilarious.
7. File formats are not as optimized as you might think! Adoption trumps elegance :/
8. I had not made the connection between bits per sample and dynamic range! Makes sense but I had never thought about it.
9. I wish more people would talk about the _experience_ of listening to different sampling rates/fidelity audio. It seems like there is some conflation of fidelity and artistic quality. Intention matters!

- how do cd's work: they rot
