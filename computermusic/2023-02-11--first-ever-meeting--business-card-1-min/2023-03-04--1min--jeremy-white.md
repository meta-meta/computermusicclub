## 1min computer club music

### Jeremy White

The first draft of my clip was a simple loop and wasn't planning to do much with it. I made it in 2019 when I was snowed in for a few days and playing around with Ableton and a AKAI MPK Mini I just bought. The clip sat for about two years until I was making a tutorial for my sister on how to add audio clips to a Twine story. I reworked the clip to be a phone conversation between two characters and played around with adding some more variation to my initial loop.

It was fun clip to play with so I decided to work on it again and add some more random things to serve as a better business card for me to share with you all. This past month I decided to add a sample from a loud Chickadee chirping during a walk in Loring Park and a short Vocaloid clip.

Chickadee clip since I've gotten really into birds in the past few years. Little Luka Vocaloid clip since I started getting into electronic music in 2010 with LSDJ, Nanoloop, C64 cynthcart, and various synthetic voice tools so thought I should include a callback to some of my first computer music creation.
